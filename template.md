## Session Notes

-   First thing I did.
-   Then I did some setup for the next thing.
-   Tried something that would produce a result I'm interested in.
    -   **[(YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM) It did something that was obviously wrong.][12345]**
        -   If that didn't work as expected, maybe this related thing would also behave in a similar way?
            -   No, that was fine.
        -   Doing this is also very similar. Let's see what happens.
            -   *(YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM) Huh. I don't know what to think of this behavior. Investigate later, maybe as part of another session.*
-   Backtrack and try something different.

## Other Notes

-   Ideas for future testing.
-   General observations, feelings or trends from the session.
