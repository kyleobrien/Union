# Union

A modern approach to SBTM documentation.

## Conventions

### Metadata

-   The "Testers" and "Tags" fields are comma-separated strings.
-   The prefered format for the "Start" and "Stop" fields is YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM, but any format that's parsable by a programming language will work.

### Session Notes

-   Notes are taken in an outline format.
-   Indicate bugs and issues with strong emphasis, using double asteriks.
-   Indicate interesting, peculiar and follow-up issues with emphasis, using a single asterik.
-   Immediately following your single or double asteriks, include a parenthesis wrapped timestamp. This helps put the item in context within the exploratory session.
-   Add screenshots with an alt-text string that starts with "Screenshot: "
-   Link issues that are filed in a big tracker with a reference-style link.
