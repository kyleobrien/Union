## Session Notes

-   Brief tour of the new functionality. Created a mind map of the UI, how it seems to be connected and hypothesized some potential states.
    -   [Mind Map of New Feature](./link_to_mind_map.ext)
-   Did some setup for the next thing.
-   Tried something that would produce a result I'm interested in.
    -   **[(2018.01.31 15:23) It let me skip a step when I pressed a button out of the order that was intended.][17005]**
        -   If that didn't work as expected, maybe doing the same thing with related UI will also behave in a similar way?
            -   No, that was fine.
        -   Doing this is also very similar. Let's see what happens.
            -   *(2018.01.31 15:27) Huh. I don't know what to think of this behavior. Investigate later, maybe as part of another session. Might need a discussion with the developer or project manager.*
-   Backtrack and try something different.
    -   There's a few menu options. Try one at a time.
        -   Option 1 is good.
        -   **(2018.01.31 15:36) Option 2 crashes the application after displaying an error message.**
            -   ![Screenshot: The error message.](./option_2_error_message.jpg)
        -   Option 3 is good.

## Other Notes

-   Based on this session, getting through the rest of the new functionality will take at least two additional sessions of equal length.
-   The provided documentation is often deficient or confusing. Talk to test lead about getting this improved, or consider a test session to focus on just the documentation. 

## Debrief

-   N/A.
